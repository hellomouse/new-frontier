Use a real logger

PIXI destroy texture after load to save memory

Work on culling - pixi does not cull


UTIL FOLDER


Add a debug console


Planet editor tool

Download fonts


Editor draw the select box if drag

    REDO CONTROLS
        Bottom bar is control/help/engineering

    Editor neater grid


    rotating slabs in place doesn't work - snap rotates too
            x and y snapping ALSO rotates

    paste - move down and to left 1 each paste, reset on camera move

    editor auto-rotate part


    Easy
    -----------------------------------------------
    Moving object - move camera if it goes off screen
    Disable launch until rocket is constructed

    //TODO collision check after rotate and move
    // Fix rotating out of bounds, make it red and invalid


    -- At this point start extensive linting --
        Tidy everything - no magic numbers, no underscore, linting and shit
            table of contents, file desc
        HTML formatting


    editor right click to edit part
    Editor select part category
    center of gravity, thrust, aero

    editor engineering report
        parachute
        comm checks
        idk
    editor no-control report
    editor control list
    editor actions
    editor crew tab
    editor save, load managment of ships

    Seperate parts ine editor into seperate rockets (not connected)



Fix sprite rotation

Matter js verticies not diagional collision box


Speed up sector rendering by computing once for both graphics and planet


SImpify polgon calculations based on camera zoom!!


If rocket is inside planet teleport it out

Load more chunks at once?

Rotate camera when in planet's atmosphere to face downwards


Relativity so ships cannot exceed lightspeed

Rather than remove the bodies from the world do this instead:

add the body to a garbage array
set the body to sleep
set the body collisionFilter so it is not colliding with anything
stop rendering the body

Easter eggs?

you have to use "stage.toLocal(pos)" to get coordinates on stage. "pos" must be something with "x" and "y"
You can calculate coordinates relative to any element in pixi, please look in the docs for "displayObject.toLocal()"
Also, there is a shortcut: "event.getLocalPosition(stage)" works just fine.
