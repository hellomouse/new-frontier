Rather than remove the bodies from the world do this instead:

add the body to a garbage array
set the body to sleep
set the body collisionFilter so it is not colliding with anything
stop rendering the body

Easter eggs?

you have to use "stage.toLocal(pos)" to get coordinates on stage. "pos" must be something with "x" and "y"
You can calculate coordinates relative to any element in pixi, please look in the docs for "displayObject.toLocal()"
Also, there is a shortcut: "event.getLocalPosition(stage)" works just fine.
