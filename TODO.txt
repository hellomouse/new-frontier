Set current rocket as controllable
    rocket.control = true;

you have to use "stage.toLocal(pos)" to get coordinates on stage. "pos" must be something with "x" and "y"
You can calculate coordinates relative to any element in pixi, please look in the docs for "displayObject.toLocal()"
Also, there is a shortcut: "event.getLocalPosition(stage)" works just fine.


Create a (dynamically calculated from rocket grid size) scale for pixels to meters

Controls
    Scroll = zoom
        camera.scale = <whatever>
        set between 0.05 and 1.9
    Left/right control rocket (later)
