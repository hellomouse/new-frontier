//TODO ERROR
decomp.Polygon is not a constructor ERROR!!

Fix weird sliding bug on the ice - rocket slides left


Speed up sector rendering by computing once for both graphics and planet


SImpify polgon calculations based on camera zoom!!


If rocket is inside planet teleport it out

Load more chunks at once?

Rotate camera when in planet's atmosphere to face downwards


Relativity so ships cannot exceed lightspeed

Rather than remove the bodies from the world do this instead:

add the body to a garbage array
set the body to sleep
set the body collisionFilter so it is not colliding with anything
stop rendering the body

Easter eggs?

you have to use "stage.toLocal(pos)" to get coordinates on stage. "pos" must be something with "x" and "y"
You can calculate coordinates relative to any element in pixi, please look in the docs for "displayObject.toLocal()"
Also, there is a shortcut: "event.getLocalPosition(stage)" works just fine.
